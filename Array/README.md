<h1> Array Data Structure</h1>
An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that stores a collection of elements in a <b>contiguous</b> block of memory.</br>
Arrays are a popular way to store lists of items, as they allow for efficient access to each element using an <b>index</b>.</br>
In Python, arrays are often represented by lists, which provide similar functionality.</br>

<u><b>Characteristics of Arrays</b></u>:

1.<b>Fixed Size</b>: 
Arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements they can hold is set when the array is created (though Python lists can be dynamically resized).</br>
2.<b>Contiguous Memory</b>:
Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access.</br>
3.<b>Indexed Access</b>:
Each element can be accessed using an index, starting from 0.</br>
4.<b>Homogeneous Elements</b>:
Typically, arrays store elements of the same data type (though Python lists allow mixed types).</br>
