An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that stores a collection of elements in a **contiguous** block of memory. Arrays are a popular way to store lists of items, as they allow for efficient access to each element using an **index**. In Python, arrays are often represented by lists, which provide similar functionality.

<u><b>Characteristics of Arrays</b></u>:

1.<b>Fixed Size</b>: 
Arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements they can hold is set when the array is created (though Python lists can be dynamically resized).
2.<b>Contiguous Memory</b>:
Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access.
3.<b>Indexed Access</b>:
Each element can be accessed using an index, starting from 0.
4.<b>Homogeneous Elements</b>:
Typically, arrays store elements of the same data type (though Python lists allow mixed types).
