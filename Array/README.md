An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that stores a collection of elements in a **contiguous** block of memory. Arrays are a popular way to store lists of items, as they allow for efficient access to each element using an **index**. In Python, arrays are often represented by lists, which provide similar functionality.

. Characteristics of Arrays
**Fixed Size**: Arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements they can hold is set when the array is created (though Python lists can be dynamically resized).
**Contiguous Memory**: Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access.
Indexed Access: Each element can be accessed using an index, starting from 0.
**Homogeneous Elements**: Typically, arrays store elements of the same data type (though Python lists allow mixed types).
