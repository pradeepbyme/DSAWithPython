<h1>Hash Table - Data Structure</h1>

A **hash table** is a data structure that provides an efficient way of storing and retrieving data using a key-value pair system. It is often used to implement associative arrays or mappings of keys to values. The primary advantage of hash tables is their average **O(1)** time complexity for **insertion, deletion, and search** operations, making them extremely fast for these operations in most cases.

### How Hash Tables Work

1.  **Hash Function**: A hash function takes an input (key) and computes an integer, called a hash code. This integer is then mapped to an index in an array (hash table). For example, a hash function might take a string like "name" and map it to an integer like 3, which corresponds to an index in the array.
    
2.  **Array (Buckets)**: The hash table itself is an array where each slot, or "bucket," can store one or more key-value pairs. Each key maps to a specific bucket based on the hash code generated by the hash function.
    
3.  **Collision Handling**: Since multiple keys can potentially hash to the same index, hash tables need a way to handle these "collisions." The two most common methods are **chaining** and **open addressing**.
    
    *   **Chaining**: Each bucket in the array points to a linked list of entries that have the same hash index. If two keys hash to the same index, they are added to the linked list in that bucket.
        
    *   **Open Addressing**: If a collision occurs, the hash table searches for the next available slot in the array using a specific probing sequence (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing) to place the new key-value pair.
        

### Operations on Hash Table

Here are the key operations supported by hash tables:

1.  **Average Time Complexity**: O(1)
    
    *   **Step 1**: Apply the hash function to the key to get the index.
        
    *   **Step 2**: Insert the key-value pair at that index.
        
    *   **Collision Handling**: If a collision occurs, use the specified collision handling method (chaining or open addressing) to resolve it.
        
2.  **Average Time Complexity**: O(1)
    
    *   **Step 1**: Apply the hash function to the key to get the index.
        
    *   **Step 2**: Go to the index and check if the key exists there.
        
    *   **Collision Handling**: If chaining is used, iterate through the linked list at that index to find the key. If open addressing is used, continue probing until you either find the key or determine that it’s not present.
        
3.  **Average Time Complexity**: O(1)
    
    *   **Step 1**: Apply the hash function to the key to find the index.
        
    *   **Step 2**: Locate the key-value pair at that index.
        
    *   **Step 3**: Remove the key-value pair from the hash table.
        
    *   **Collision Handling**: If chaining is used, delete the node from the linked list. If open addressing is used, mark the slot as "deleted" to avoid shifting elements unnecessarily.
        
4.  **Average Time Complexity**: O(1)
    
    *   This operation involves searching for a key and updating its corresponding value. It’s similar to searching, with an additional step to replace the old value with a new one if the key is found.
        

### Pros and Cons of Hash Tables

#### Pros:

*   **Fast Access**: Hash tables offer constant-time complexity on average for insert, search, and delete.
    
*   **Efficient for Large Data**: Hash tables can handle large datasets well.
    

#### Cons:

*   **Collisions**: Hash collisions can affect performance, especially if the hash table isn't sized appropriately.
    
*   **Memory Usage**: Hash tables can use more memory due to additional structures for handling collisions.
    
*   **Poor Performance for Sequential Access**: Hash tables are not ideal for operations that require sequential access to data (like arrays or linked lists).
    

### Applications of Hash Tables

*   **Database Indexing**: Hash tables are used to store indices for quick lookups.
    
*   **Caching**: Often used in caching to store frequently accessed data.
    
*   **Associative Arrays**: Implement dictionaries or maps where data can be accessed via keys.
    
*   **Set Operations**: Implementing sets where elements are unique and can be efficiently checked.</br>
